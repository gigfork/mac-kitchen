Mac Kitchen
===========

To get started with the process on a new Mac the only thing you
have to manually install is **Xcode**, its **Command Line Tools** and
this kitchen.

The prerequisites for the installation a Mac with Mac OS 10.7+. The
bootstrap process is assuming that the user's shell is bash. This is
important for the proper configuration of [rbenv](github/rbenv).

Installing Xcode
----------------
You can install Xcode via the Mac App Store. After you are
done installing Xcode open it up and got to the preferences. Under
downloads you can then install the Command Line Tools. This gives you a
basic foundation to install the rest of the apps through the bootstrap
script.
